#Interfaces gráficas GIT
##giggle
Giggle is a graphical frontend for the git content tracker (think of gitk on GTK+). 
##git-cola
Git-cola is developed in Python and comes with the usual pull, push, commit functions. It also comes with a diff-viewer and file staging mode.
##gitg
gitg is a simple application. You can commit changes and view the repositories in graphical display. There is also the diff viewer and a file browser, that’s all. Some people love this as a git viewer because of the colorful graphs and great organization, making it easier to see the changes.
